The Hobbit had, for the time, quite an advanced language recognition system. 
To progress though the game you have to use words from the game dictionary to
interact with other characters and objects.  The following words are the only
ones the game will recognize when used in conjunction with words from the game.
 Some can be shortened, so for example instead of typing DOWN, you can just
type D.

5. COMMUNICATING WITH THE GAME

You can only talk to the game in a certain way.  You have to use the words in
the right order and be quite specific or the game will not understand.  Here
are some examples, I have quoted them directly from the manual as I think they
are quite sweetly written and do get the point across direct from the game
designers mouth!  The designers invented a new name for this "computer speak" -
INGLISH (not ENGLISH), I have NO idea why, but it sounds cool and it's not a
misprint!

6. THE RULES OF INGLISH

With the help of this program, your program is now able to talk
to you in INGLISH.  What's more, you will be able to talk to the
computer in INGLISH, and it will understand what you say!

INGLISH is the most sophisticated natural language recognition
program yet developed on any microcomputer, and Melbourne House
are very proud to be able to bring this implementation to you in
THE HOBBIT program.

The rules of INGLISH are simple - you probably already know
INGLISH without even being aware of it.

- Each sentence must have a verb.
   As a minimum sentence, you can have just the verb.
   For example:  RUN
                 CLIMB
                 WAIT
   These sentences are all fine.

   The meaning of the verbs may be altered by the use of adverbs,
such as
           RUN QUICKLY
        or VICIOUSLY BREAK THE DOOR

- Normal grammar applies, and the order of the different parts
of the sentence is not critical.

   For example, the following two sentences are both valid, and
both have the same meaning:
    WITH THE SWORD CAREFULLY ATTACK THE TROLL
    ATTACK THE TROLL CAREFULLY WITH THE SWORD.

- Adjectives which describe objects must come before the noun.
If it sound right, it probably is right.
    OPEN THE GREEN DOOR is right.
but OPEN THE DOOR GREEN is not.

This is pretty obvious.  If it sounds odd to you, you can be sure
the computer is likely to think so too.

- Prepositions, such as WITH, UNDER, ON, OFF and so on, usually
come before the noun in INGLISH:
    ATTACK WITH THE SWORD.
    PICK UP THE GOLD.

There are some verbs where the preposition could go before or
after, or where the more natural sounding sentence is with the
preposition last.  For example in:
   TURN THE LIGHT ON.
   PICK THE GOLD UP.
These are also acceptable.

Use of AND

You can use the word "AND" in all its normal meaning in INGLISH!
This means, among other things, that you can enter more than one
sentence at a time.

The following sentences illustrates different meanings of the
word AND:
   TAKE THE LAMP AND THE ROPE OUT OF THE BARREL.
   DROP THE SHORT AND THE LONG SWORDS.
   TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.

With the use of INGLISH, your computer will be able to understand
all the sentences correctly.

Punctuation

Different sentences should be separated by some sort of
punctuation - use AND, commas, semi-colons, and full stops as you
normally would.

The only limitation placed by the computer on how many sentences
you can enter at one time is a total limit of 128 characters.

Of course, keep in mind that each time you do something, the
other creatures may also decide to do something and you could end
up with some unexpected results if you enter too many commands
at once.

Using ALL, EVERYTHING and EXCEPT

It may not be convenient for you to enter the description of
every object in the room if you should wish to pick everything
up.

Therefore you can generalise by the use of ALL, EVERYTHING and
EXCEPT, just as you normally would.

You may qualify what you actually want to manipulate - in other
words you can say ALL DWARVES, or you can say EVERYTHING EXCEPT
GREEN BOTTLES.

The following are examples of valid sentences:

   EAT EVERYTHING
   OPEN ALL EXCEPT THE GREEN BOTTLE.
   BREAK ALL BOTTLES EXCEPT THE GREEN ONE.

Limitation of INGLISH

- To describe an object, you can only use the objects name and
its adjectives (if any).  For example, if you see that there is
some delicious foaming beer in a bottle, you could say:
   DRINK BEER
or DRINK DELICIOUS BEER
or DRINK FOAMING BEER
or DRINK DELICIOUS FOAMING BEER
or DRINK FOAMING DELICIOUS BEER

All these would result in quenching your thirst.
You cannot use the position of an object as its description.
This means that a sentence such as
   DRINK BEER IN BOTTLE
is not acceptable.

- You cannot have more than one indirect object in a sentence.
Basically this means that you cannot specify doing one thing in
more than one way.

For example, you could say
   PUT THE ROPE ON THE TABLE
or you could decide to put it on the chair:
   PUT THE ROPE ON THE CHAIR

but you cannot put the rope on but the table and on the chair at
the same time.

You therefore can't say
   PUT THE ROPE ON TABLE AND CHAIR

This is a general rule, and means that you can't say things like:
   ATTACK WOLVES WITH EVERYTHING.

We feel that these limitations are fairly minor, and that you
should be able to express yourself exactly the way you feel most
comfortable.


7. MOVEMENT AND COMMUNICATION

So that's how you use the games language system!  Sound more complicated than
it actually is really.  In the same vein talking to characters is accomplished
in the same way.  So if Gandalf appears and you need to talk to him just type
in, SAY TO GANDALF "READ MAP".  He may say no, he may say yes, it's worth
asking again if they refuse the first time.  Gandalf also has the tendency to
appear and disappear just to annoy you, don't attack him no matter how tempting
it seems, he will just kill you (boo).  You can use the command FOLLOW to chase
after characters.

If you want to move around you can only go in the directions offered to you. 
So if you are in a place and the only exits are East and West, only the
commands GO EAST or GO WEST (GO E, GO W) will let you move to another place. 
You can also use commands like CROSS RIVER etc.

The game also uses the passage of time, if you leave the game idle.  Time will
pass, night will fall, day will dawn.  Some area's can only be passed at
certain times of day.  Use the WAIT command to hang about until the time is
right.  In general if you find yourself in a dangerous area, get out and wait
for Thorin or Gandalf to turn up.  You are a Hobbit and you suck at fighting. 
Get the tough guys to do your dirty work for you. For example, you are in the
mountains and a VICIOUS WARG has appeared from the WEST, you can either RUN
EAST or SAY TO GANDALF "KILL WARG", if you're lucky he'll kill it for you.  If
not the WARG eats you and you die.  No one ever said being a Hobbit was easy!
